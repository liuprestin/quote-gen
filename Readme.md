"rem" - realtive size to root element ... 
16px typcially on mobile devices...

on emmet:
. class
# id
> looks like the next level of encapsulation

Idea Changes:
- can import to parcel JS would make handling the rest of the project much more easier 
- can import MORE quotes  
- can change the overall style of the webpage

notice:
- website frontend was done 1st in this case
- note the considerations made when they look at it, they consider what this website/app is running on and relative readability
- when implementing the site they work very efficently on setting it up
- one is also aware where each element is wanted to be placed... down to the geometric measurement (engineering pov)
- feels much more intentional on how they do things
- what do you (or "we") want? 
- how do you target each element? (literally via its id or class)
- what are the pesudo classes?
- notice how console.log() (and similar print functions) are used to implement checking for a response...
- notice that console.log() displays the object type and the dev can see whats in the object. HERE we can determine how to use and access other parts of that object (eg. array)
- also note how they break functions down - based on what is wanted. Ie. we want the quotes to be random - so we can break the request down by another function...
