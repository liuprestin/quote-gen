"rem" - realtive size to root element ... 
16px typcially on mobile devices...

on emmet:
. class
# id
> looks like the next level of encapsulation

Idea Changes:
- can import to parcel JS would make handling the rest of the project much more easier 
- can import MORE quotes  
- can change the overall style of the webpage

notice:
- website frontend was done 1st in this case
- note the considerations made when they look at it, they consider what this website/app is running on and relative readability
- when implementing the site they work very efficently on setting it up
- one is also aware where each element is wanted to be placed...
